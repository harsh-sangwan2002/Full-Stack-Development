# 📚 Scaler Academy DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems covered in the **Scaler Academy** Intermediate and Advanced curriculum. I'm solving questions topic-wise from various categories such as Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Greedy, Dynamic Programming (DP), Two-Pointers, Sorting, Hashing, and more.
