# 📝 React To-Do List – State Management Demo

This project showcases how to effectively manage **state in React** using the `useState` hook through a functional **To-Do List Application**. It emphasizes dynamic UI updates, state persistence, and best practices in modern React development.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Add new to-do items dynamically
- Update UI automatically on state changes
- Built with functional React components and hooks
- Demonstrates conditional rendering
- Highlights differences between state and props

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🔹 React State

State in React refers to component-specific data that determines how a component behaves and renders. React's `useState` hook allows functional components to store and manage this data.

State persists across re-renders, unlike traditional JavaScript variables. This persistence is crucial for maintaining consistent UI behavior as users interact with the app.

### 🔹 Managing To-Do List State

In the context of this project, a state variable holds the list of to-do items. When a new task is added, the state is updated using the provided state updater function. This triggers a re-render and displays the updated list without manual DOM manipulation.

The project ensures immutability by creating a new array every time a new to-do is added. This approach ensures React’s diffing algorithm can detect and render changes efficiently.

### 🔹 Props vs. State

**Props** are immutable and used to pass data from parent to child components.
**State** is mutable and local to a component, used to handle dynamic data and re-render the UI accordingly.

A clear separation of props and state improves modularity and maintainability in React applications.

## 🎯 Conditional Rendering

React enables developers to conditionally render components based on the state or props. This pattern is used to show or hide components like login forms, messages, or action buttons depending on the current application state.

---

## 🧱 To-Do List Workflow

1. The user types a new task in an input field.
2. On clicking "Add", an event handler updates the state with the new task.
3. The component re-renders and the updated list is shown immediately.
4. Each item in the list is displayed dynamically using array mapping.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- Components are organized into modular files.
- A central functional component manages the app logic and UI.
- Styles can be applied using CSS or libraries like Tailwind or MUI as needed.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using a package manager like npm or yarn
3. Run the development server
4. Interact with the To-Do list to see state management in action
