- TypeScript Basics (Variables, Functions, Classes, Interfaces, Types, Enums, etc.)
- Advanced TypeScript Concepts (Generics, Mapped Types, Utility Types, etc.)
- TypeScript with Webpack
- TypeScript with React
- TypeScript Configuration and Compilation
- Best Practices in TypeScript Development

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **TypeScript** - The primary focus of this repository.
- **React** - Used for demonstrating React with TypeScript.
