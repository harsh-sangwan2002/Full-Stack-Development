Full-Stack Development Portfolio
Welcome to my Full-Stack Development repository! This project showcases a comprehensive collection of my work across frontend, backend, data science, interview preparation, and data structures & algorithms (DSA). Built with a passion for coding and problem-solving, this repository includes a variety of projects, tools, and resources to demonstrate my expertise in multiple programming languages and frameworks.

üåü Overview
This repository is a one-stop hub for my coding journey, featuring projects and resources in:

Frontend: React.js, HTML/CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
Backend: Node.js, Express, Spring Boot, Java, Python
Systems Programming: C/C++
Data Science: Python-based data analysis and machine learning projects
Interview Prep & DSA: Solutions to common coding problems and algorithmic challenges
Miscellaneous: Full-stack applications, APIs, and more

Each section is organized to help you navigate through my projects and explore the technologies I‚Äôve worked with.
