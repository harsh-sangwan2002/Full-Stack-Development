Revision Notes: JavaScript Operators and Functions
Introduction
In this session, we delved into fundamental JavaScript concepts including operators and functions, diving deep into how they work within the language. Below, you'll find a comprehensive breakdown of what was covered, along with explanations and examples for better understanding.

JavaScript Operators
Types of Operators

1. Arithmetic Operators:

Simple mathematical operations: +, -, \*, /, ++ (increment), -- (decrement), % (modulus). 2. Assignment Operators:

Assigning values: =, +=, -=, \*=, /=, %= which perform a calculation and assignment in one step【4:6†transcript.txt】. 3. Comparison Operators:

Compare values: ==, === (strict equality), !=, !== (strict inequality), >, <, >=, <=【4:4†transcript.txt】.
Strict vs. Loose Equality:
=== checks for both value and type match.
== performs type coercion before comparison【4:1†transcript.txt】. 4. Logical Operators:

Logical operations: && (and), || (or), ! (not)【4:4†transcript.txt】. 5. Bitwise Operators:

Operate on bits (not covered in detail)【4:7†transcript.txt】. 6. Type Operators:

typeof: Returns the type of a variable or expression【4:14†transcript.txt】.
Use Cases of Operators
Arithmetic in E-commerce: Adding products to a cart uses +, calculating discounts may use -, and computing total prices involves \*【4:13†transcript.txt】.
Functions in JavaScript
Function Declaration
Functions are defined using the function keyword followed by the name and parameters.
Example function declaration:
function add(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
Named vs. Anonymous Functions
Named Function: Functions with a specific name for identification and reuse.
Anonymous Function: Functions without a name, often used as arguments or assigned to variables.
Arrow Functions
A simplified syntax for writing functions.
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
Function Expressions
Functions can be stored in variables, and expressions can be named or anonymous.
Examples:
const add = function(a, b) { return a + b; };
Higher-order Functions
Definition: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.
Example: An event listener where you pass a callback function.
Context and Hoisting in Functions
Execution Context: Environment in which code is evaluated (global and function context)【4:16†transcript.txt】.
Hoisting: JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations to the top of the scope before execution【4:12†typed.md】.
Temporary Dead Zone: Applies to let and const where they are not accessible before initialization【4:18†transcript.txt】.
Practical Exercise
Manipulating Arrays and Objects: Understanding of splice and slice within context of removing and replacing items【4:11†transcript.txt】.
Use in Callbacks and Closures: Function within a function and returning a function from another【4:19†transcript.txt】.
Analogies and Examples
Use of everyday scenarios like grocery shopping to understand operators.
Function definition similarities to recipes for making tea, where each type of tea is akin to a different function setup【4:17†transcript.txt】.
Conclusion
This session equipped learners with the foundational concepts of JavaScript operators and functions, preparing them for more advanced programming concepts. Understanding these basics is key to mastering JavaScript as they form the building blocks of any application.
