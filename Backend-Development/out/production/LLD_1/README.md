# Java Fundamentals & Low-Level Design Practice (LLD_1)

This project is a curated collection of **Java programming modules** focusing on core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, **concurrency**, **generics**, **streams**, **functional interfaces**, and **low-level design (LLD)** building blocks.

> Ideal for beginners and intermediate developers preparing for interviews, improving Java fundamentals, or transitioning into system design.

## üìÅ Module Overview

| Folder Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `AccessModifiersConstructors02` | Practice with Java access modifiers and constructors. |
| `AdderSubtractor` | Simple adder-subtractor logic to explore multi-threading basics. |
| `Collections` | Demonstrates Java Collection framework (List, Map, Set, etc.). |
| `Concurrency01` / `Concurrency02` | Hands-on with multi-threading, synchronization, and concurrent programming. |
| `ExceptionHandling` / `Exceptions` | Custom and built-in exception handling in Java. |
| `FunctionalInterface` | Exploring Java 8's functional interfaces and lambda expressions. |
| `Generics` | Type-safe generic programming examples. |
| `InheritancePolymorphism03` | OOP fundamentals ‚Äî inheritance, method overriding, and polymorphism. |
| `InterfacesAbstractClass04` | Interface vs abstract class implementation examples. |
| `IntroToPLLDOPS01` | Introduction to core programming logic and object-oriented structure. |
| `ProducerConsumer` | Classical concurrency problem implementation using wait-notify. |
| `Streams` | Java 8+ Stream API usage for data processing. |

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17+ recommended)
- IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE)
- No external libraries; pure core Java

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harsh-sangwan2002/Full-Stack-Development.git
   cd Full-Stack-Development/Backend-Development/LLD_1/src
   ```
   
2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code (with Java support).

3. Navigate to any module folder and run the main class (Main.java or equivalent).

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Build a strong grasp of Java fundamentals

- Understand low-level design patterns and code structure
