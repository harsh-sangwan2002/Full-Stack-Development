     * Question-1: What do you understand by browser?
     * Answer-> It is a software application that helps us to access information on the internet and presnt in human redable form.
     * 
     * Question-2: What are the different components/feature that makes ups a browser.
     * Answer->

     * 2. JS Engine.
     * 3. Rendering Engine(Convert code into UI)
     * 4. Networking(I have the capability to interact with outer world)
     * 5. Dev tools
     * 6. History.
     * 8. Bookmarks.
     * 
     * Question-3: How browser allows to access these features developer -> developing a UI app ??
     * Answer:
     * 1. WEB API: is the interface to access all the components or the features.
     * 2. API(Application programming interface): API is an object that represent a feature and developer can interact with API using it's exposed prop and methods.
     * 3. You can use JS to interact with all these API
     * 4. WEB API: console, DOM API, web storage API, Fetch API etc.,
     * 
     * First Principle is: To implement any feature -> You have to use an API given by Browser and that API 
     * is always an object -> method and props and we will use JS to do it.
