# 🌐 My First Next.js App

Welcome to my very first project built using the **Next.js** framework! 🚀
Deployed live at: [https://harsh-first-next.vercel.app](https://harsh-first-next.vercel.app)

It was built to explore:

- ✅ Server-side rendering (SSR)
- ✅ File-based routing
- ✅ Built-in CSS support
- ✅ Optimized image handling
- ✅ Lightning-fast deployment with **Vercel**
